# WaterSpout2

This sketch is under construction. It is a p5.js JavaScript port of an old Processing sketch I wrote for Coursera's Creative Programming for Digital Media and Mobile Apps. Right now it is functioning only as a drum machine :( I'm still thinking of how to design the synthesizer functionality. 

# Usage !!
Click on the drops to trigger percussion. Double click the orb's perimeter to drag it onto other orbs and swap drum sounds. Experiment with timing by playing orbs with differing drop number alongside one another. Note: The little tadpoles don't really do anything yet, but they will be attracted to your dragging motion. Give [it a try!!](https://rortms.github.io/WaterSpout2/)

# Issues

At least on my laptop it does suffer from slowdown, which ruins its coolness somewhat. It might not be an issue with better hardware, haven't tested it. Dragging an orb sometimes enduces buggy behavior where it gets stuck to some residual memory of a previous position. Double clicking anywhere usually dislodges it but I have to look into it.
