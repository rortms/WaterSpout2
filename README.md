# WaterSpout2

This sketch is under construction. It is a p5.js JavaScript port of an old Processing sketch I wrote for Coursera's Creative Programming for Digital Media and Mobile Apps. Right now it is functioning only as a drum machine :( I'm still thinking of how to design the synthesizer functionality. 

# Usage !!
Click on the drops to trigger percussion. Double click the ring's perimeter to drag it onto other rings and swap drum sounds. Experiment with timing by playing different sized rings alongside one another. Note: The little tadpoles don't really do anything yet, but they will be attracted to your dragging motion. Give [it a try!!](https://rortms.github.io/WaterSpout2/)
